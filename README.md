# Glitch Missing Assets

[Tiny Speck](http://tinyspeck.com) recently released the artwork assets for their MMO [Glitch](http://www.glitchthegame.com). There were a number of files missing in that set, and some FLA files that could not be opened. This repo is an attempt to fill in some of those gaps.

## Location Assets

These are some of the location assets that were either missing or corrupt from [the original repo](https://github.com/tinyspeck/glitch-locations). There were SWFs available for all of these. I have run these through a decompiler and generated FLAs and PNGs for these files. Note there are still some items referenced in the location assets that are missing.
